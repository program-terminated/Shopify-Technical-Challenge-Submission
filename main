Question 1.


Answer to 1a)
The naive calculation of an average order value of $3145.13 was obtained by dividing the total amount of money made from the sales based on the number of sales made.
This figure is so high because there are a select few orders that cost a significant more amount than all the others. Namely, multiple orders of $704,000 to shop 42. These orders
are bringing the average order value up much higher than one would expect.

Answer to 1b)
The metric I would use for this dataset would be average sneaker value. That is, the average amount of money spent on a single pair of sneakers.

Answer to 1c)
I would calculate average sneaker value (ASV) by first summing all of the money made from all the orders. Doing this, I get a total of $15,725,640 made from all 5000 orders. Now,
rather than divide this figure by the number of orders, I sum the total number of sneaker pairs sold. The result I get is that 43,936 pairs of sneakers were sold. Dividing the
total amount of money made by the number of sneaker pairs sold, we get an answer of $357.92 per sneaker pair.


Question 2.

Answer to 2a)
To answer this question, I first found that Speedy Express have a ShipperID of 1. I then searched for all orders where the ShipperID was 1 and got 54 results. Thus, Speedy Express
shipped a total of 54 orders.

Answer to 2b)
I first found from the list of employees that the employees have IDs ranging from 1-10 inclusive, I simply searched through all orders where the employee ID was equal to a 
number between 1-10 inclusive. After doing this for each ID, I found that the employee with EmployeeID = 4 had the most orders, with 40. 
I then returned to the list of employees and found that the employee with EmployeeID = 4 was Margaret Peacock. Thus, the last name of the employee with the most orders is
Peacock.

Answer to 2c)
My first step in solving this problem was determining the CustomerIDs of every customer from Germany. I searched the Customers bank where Country = "Germany" and found that there
were 11 results. The CustomerIDs of the 11 customers from Germany are: 1 6 17 25 39 44 52 56 63 79 86.
Now that I had the CustomerIDs, I searched through all the orders based on these CustomerIDs to determine what the ProductIDs were for each order. The results are shown below:

CustomerID    # of Orders   OrderID(s)
  1                 0           N/A
  6                 0           N/A
  17                2           10363, 10391
  25                4           10267, 10337, 10342, 10396
  39                2           10323, 10325
  44                3           10279, 10284, 10343
  52                1           10277
  56                1           10407
  63                7           10273, 10285, 10286, 10313, 10345, 10361, 10418
  79                1           10438
  86                4           10301, 10312, 10348, 10356
