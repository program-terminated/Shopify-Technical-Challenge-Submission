Question 1.


Answer to 1a)
The naive calculation of an average order value of $3145.13 was obtained by dividing the total amount of money made from the sales based on the number of sales made.
This figure is so high because there are a select few orders that cost a significant more amount than all the others. Namely, multiple orders of $704,000 to shop 42.
These orders are bringing the average order value up much higher than one would expect.

Answer to 1b)
The metric I would use for this dataset would be average sneaker value. That is, the average amount of money spent on a single pair of sneakers.

Answer to 1c)
I would calculate average sneaker value (ASV) by first summing all of the money made from all the orders. Doing this, I get a total of $15,725,640 made from all 5000 orders. 
Now, rather than divide this figure by the number of orders, I sum the total number of sneaker pairs sold. The result I get is that 43,936 pairs of sneakers were sold. 
Dividing the total amount of money made by the number of sneaker pairs sold, we get an answer of $357.92 per sneaker pair.


Question 2.

Answer to 2a)
To answer this question, I first found that Speedy Express has a ShipperID of 1. I then searched for all orders where the ShipperID was 1 and got 54 results. Thus, 
Speedy Express shipped a total of 54 orders.

Answer to 2b)
I first found from the list of employees that the employees have IDs ranging from 1-10 inclusive, I simply searched through all orders where the employee ID was equal to a 
number between 1-10 inclusive. After doing this for each ID, I found that the employee with EmployeeID = 4 had the most orders, with 40. 
I then returned to the list of employees and found that the employee with EmployeeID = 4 was Margaret Peacock. Thus, the last name of the employee with the most orders is
Peacock.

Answer to 2c)
My first step in solving this problem was determining the CustomerIDs of every customer from Germany. I searched the Customers bank where Country = "Germany" and found that 
there were 11 results. The CustomerIDs of the 11 customers from Germany are: 1 6 17 25 39 44 52 56 63 79 86.
Now that I had the CustomerIDs, I searched through all the orders based on these CustomerIDs to determine what the ProductIDs were for each order. The results are shown below:

CustomerID  OrderID(s)
  1           N/A
  6           N/A
  17          10363, 10391
  25          10267, 10337, 10342, 10396
  39          10323, 10325
  44          10279, 10284, 10343
  52          10277
  56          10407
  63          10273, 10285, 10286, 10313, 10345, 10361, 10418
  79          10438
  86          10301, 10312, 10348, 10356

Now that we have the OrderIDs, we can determine the ProductIDs of all the searches as well as the quantity of each product in each order. That is, I searched through
OrderDetails for all orders with the OrderIDs shown above and for a specific ProductID. I also used the SUM command to sum the quantity to determine which ProductID had the
highest quantity sold among all the orders made by customers from Germany. Doing this for each ProductID, I found that ProductID = 40 had the highest quantity sold to
customers from Germany, with a quantity of 160.

Lastly, I checked the Products page to find that the product with ProductID = 40 is Boston Crab Meat.

Thus, the product that was ordered the most by customers in Germany was Boston Crab Meat.
